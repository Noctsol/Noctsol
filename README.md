ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Noctsol

I have no clue what I am doing. Let's get along and pull out some duct tape.

**About Me:**
- I'm lazy, and I assume I am incompetent. Therefore:
  - If a tool exists that already solves my problem, I would rather use that
  - If I can use a managed instance of something, I would rather use that
  - The less work I have to do, the better
  - The less my human incompetency can mess with my work, the better

- I generally prefer clarity when coding. Therefore:
  - I will generally write code in an easy to understand manner especially if performance does not matter
  - Not use ungodly amounts of shorthand
  - Try to write code in a human-readable manner

_Laborare quia spes_
